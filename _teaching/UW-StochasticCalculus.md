TThe goal of this course is to establish the main principles of stochastic calculus within the simplest setting of stochastic integration with respect to continuous semimartingales. Our emphasis will be on the basic principles and theorems of stochastic calculus rather than on specific applications.

The main prerequisites for enrolling in this course are competence in basic measure theory (Lebesgue integral and its properties, convergence theorems, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Fubini-Tonelli theorem, extension theorem for measures) and elementary probability theory (independence, expectations, con- ditional expectations).

### Contents:
1. Preliminaries: brief overview of prerequisites, introduction to monotone and Dynkin classes of sets, monotone and Dynkin class theorems.
2. Discrete-parameter martingales: discrete-parameter filtrations and stopping times, optional sam- pling theorem, supermartingale inequalities, supermartingale convergence theorem, uniform integra- bility and uniformly integrable supermartingales.
3. Elements of continuous-parameter stochastic processes: processes with independent increments, the Wiener process, continuous-parameter filtrations and standard filtrations, continuous-parameter stopping times, corlol processes, progressively measurable processes.
4. Continuous-parameter martingales: structure of (super)-martingale sample paths, continuous- parameter analogs of the main results for discrete-parameter martingales, continuous local martin- gales, quadratic variation process of a continuous local martingale.
5. Stochastic integration of progressively measurable integrands : sample-path integrals with re- spect to processes of locally-bounded variation, Kunita-Watanabe inequalities and Ito integrals with respect to continuous local martingales and continuous semimartingales, Itoâ€™s formula, exponential local martingales, Novikov theorem, martingale characterization of the Wiener process, changes of measure and the Girsanov theorem.
6. Representation of local martingales as stochastic integrals.
