The purpose of the course is to introduce computationally intensive techniques for pricing and risk management in modern finance.

The focus will be mostly on Monte Carlo simulation methods, but other techniques will also be discussed. Because of the project component, the course provides an opportunity for independent investigation of a specific problem in finance and to communicate the results of this investigation.

1. Basic Monte Carlo Methods (~4 weeks):
  - Generating random variables for uniform and non-uniform random variates
  - Variance reduction techniques:
    - Control variates
    - Antithetic variates
    - Importance sampling
    - Stratified sampling
2. Monte Carlo Methods for Multivariate Models (~ 6 weeks):
  - Generating random variables:
    - Copula based simulation methods
    - Markov Chain Monte Carlo
    - Methods for different classes of stochastic processes:
      - Forward discretization methods for diffusion processes (with applications to Heston, HJM and LIBOR models)
      - Non-homogenous Poisson processes and processes with stochastic intensity (for reduced-form models of credit risk)
      - Levy processes; jump-diffusion models
  - Quasi-Monte Carlo methods with applications
3. Additional topics (only some will be covered in class; ~ 2 weeks):
  - Pricing American options.
  - Pricing methods based on Fourier and other transformations.
  - Calculation of Greeks.
  - Specialized variance reduction techniques.
  - Sequential Monte Carlo (particle filters).
  - Multilevel path simulation for SDEs
