The course introduces options and other derivative securities in different asset classes.

The main focus is on methods of pricing in a multi-period setting, but continuous-time models are also discussed. We will begin with an introduction to financial markets and instruments. This will be followed by a study of classical models of portfolio selection, which will lead into statistical (linear factor) models of asset prices. We will then study the pricing of derivatives, as well as general notions of optimality and financial market equilibrium, in a discrete setting, which contains all of the key mathematical intuition for models based on more advanced mathematics (and is also very useful for the numerical methods needed for such models). We will then cover the basics of models for portfolio risk management, including credit risk, and a first application of statistical learning to finance (credit scoring). The course will conclude with an introduction to diffusion models in finance, and the Black-Scholes model in particular.
