I investigate into the optimal consumption, investment and life insurance decision of a family with working couple. The main goal is to maximize the expected utility functions of the family subject to a certain wealth process.

The optimal solutions has been proved by Kwak(2017) using the martingale approach. I try to prove the result by another classical method in optimization problem which is the dynamic programming technique.

Using the CRRA(constant relative risk aversion) utility functions, analytical solutions can be obtained, which is discussed in the end by numerical examples and figures.
