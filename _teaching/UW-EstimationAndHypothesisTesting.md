Discussion of inference problems under the headings of hypothesis testing and point and interval estimation.

### Topics:

- Properties of Estimators:  
Short review of re-requisite material; unbiasedness and MSE; unbiasedness; UMVUE; C- R inequality and Fisher Information; sufficiency; completeness; Ancillarity; exponential family
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation:  
Principles of MLE; one-parameter and multi-parameter methods; asymptotic properties; EM algorithm; likelihood intervals/regions
- Methods of Estimation (other than MLE):  
Best linear unbiased estimators; equivariant Estimators; Estimating Equations; Bayes Estimation
- Test of Hypotheses:  
Null and alternative hypotheses; type I and type II error; power function; general test- ing procedure; tests with normal populations; uniformly most powerful tests; Neyman- Pearson Lemma; unbiased test; locally most powerful tests; generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test; goodness-of-fit test; tests based on asymptotic distributions; Bayesian tests
- Interval Estimation:  
Pivotal quantities; confidence intervals; associated hypothesis tests; inversion of hypoth- esis tests to get confidence sets; GLR confidence intervals; Bayesian intervals.
