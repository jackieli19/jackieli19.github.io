In this project, I learn the concept of deep learning, the algorithm of AlphaGo and replicate the first stage which is the supervised learning. The AlphaGo, by combining the policy network and value network, deploying the reinforcement learning algorithm and using a more advanced MCTS, it becomes the strongest Go player in the world. The success of AlphaGo inspires us a lot in the future development of artificial intelligence. As for our implementation, the final result we get from the training of our model is quite satisfied and we reach the same 57% accuracy as AlphaGo. Finally, we attach our model to a GTP engine and make it a 4-dan amateur go player. As for the future implementation, we will continue training the value network and applying the reinforcement learning algorithm into our model. The next stage may be a replication of the newest AlphaGo Zero.
